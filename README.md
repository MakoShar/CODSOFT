# CODSOFT
Welcome Back,

Dear Sir/Madam,

This repository serves as a record of my internship with CODSOFT. All projects I completed during my internship are included here.

I hope these meet your expectations.

Sincerely,
Anoop Verma

1. Calculator Project:
I approached the Calculator by focusing on core C++ input, output, and decision-making. I set up the user interface to get two numbers and an operation choice. The project's logic was primarily driven by a switch statement to perform the selected arithmetic, with basic goto-based error handling for invalid input. This solidified my understanding of fundamental operations and branching.

2. Number Guessing Game Project:
For the Number Guessing Game, the key was generating a truly random target number using rand() seeded by time(0). I then implemented a while loop for a fixed number of guesses. Inside the loop, if-else if statements provided feedback ("Too high!", "Too low!") and validated the guess's range. This project enhanced my skills in randomness, loops, and interactive feedback.

3. To Do List Project:
The To Do List was tackled with a focus on persistent data storage using file handling. I created functions (add_Task, view_Task) to read from and write tasks to a "task.txt" file using C-style file I/O functions like fopen, fgets, and fputs. This was crucial for ensuring tasks were saved between sessions and significantly improved my understanding of data persistence.
